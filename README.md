### Description
A puzzle I made in Unity with C#.
This would  potentially for use in a spaceship-themed escape room. Here, the scenario would be that you have a control panel with an array of buttons and a lever on the right that doesn't seem to do a lot. Another puzzle releases a knob that you use to complete the lever on the left side which seems to start lighting things up...
On completion of this puzzle, nearby screens that have so far only been showing static would come on to reveal the ship's diagnostics systems.
